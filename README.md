        ]
)
```

## Usage
### Unknown duration

Usage for Tasks of unknown duration, call the infinite (aeon) function block: 

```swift
print("Signal Type".bold)
let signalMsg = "ðŸ”¥ Long Job".bold + " .signal ".blue + " type".bold
let signalCompleteMsg = "Long Job".bold + " .signal ".blue + "type done".bold
waitForAsync { stopWaiting in
    aeon(.signal, signalMsg, signalCompleteMsg) { start, complete in
       let wget = SwiftShell.run("which", "wget").stdout
        runAsync(wget,"-P", "/tmp" , "http://ipv4.download.thinkbroadband.com/20MB.zip").onCompletion { command in
            complete()
            stopWaiting()
        }
        start()
   }
}
```

Use one of the AeonType's to define the look and feel of the progress animation.
```swift
enum AeonType {
    case led
    case led2
    case moon
    case signal
}
```

### Known duration

To show the progress bar for Tasks with known duration

```swift
print("Pac Bar".bold)
print()
        
var index = 0
        
barz(type: .pac, total: files.count) { update, complete in
    files.forEach { file in
        let  headerMessage = "Copying file ".blue.bold + TRAFIC_LIGHT + " " + file.green.bold
                
        update(index + 1, headerMessage)
                
        //Do the heavy lifting here
        
        index += 1
    }
    complete()
}
```

Use one of the BarType's to define the look and feel of the progress animation.

```swift
public enum BarType {
    case pac
    case pac2
    case bars
}
```
